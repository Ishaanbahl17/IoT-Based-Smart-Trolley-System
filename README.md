# IoT-Based-Smart-Trolley-System

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an IoT-based smart shopping trolley that simplifies the in-store shopping experience by integrating a manual RFID-based product scanning system and real-time item weight monitoring. The trolley enables users to scan each item by placing its RFID tag on a reader, calculates the total cost, and displays important data like item prices and weight directly on onboard displays.

With separate display unitsâ€”LCD for item prices and total cost, and a 0.95" OLED (SSD1306) for weight trackingâ€”this project offers a step towards more interactive and self-service shopping in smart retail setups.

 Key Features
 Manual RFID Scanning: Users scan items by placing RFID tags on the reader; the system then identifies the item and fetches its price.

 Real-Time Billing: Automatically calculates and displays the total bill and item-wise prices on an LCD screen.

 Weight Display on OLED: Shows the live weight of items in the trolley using HX711 + Load Cell, output on a 0.95-inch OLED (SSD1306) display.

 Dual Display System:

LCD: Item name, price, total cost.

OLED: Total weight in kilograms or grams.

IoT Expandable: Design is modular for future integration with cloud platforms and mobile applications.

How It Works
Each product is assigned an RFID tag.

The shopper places the RFID tag over the RFID reader (RC522) manually to scan the item.

The system fetches the item's price and weight from a predefined database or code.

The LCD screen displays the item's name, price, and continuously updated total cost.

Meanwhile, the HX711 load cell measures the current weight of items in the trolley, which is shown on the OLED screen.

This gives the user a full view of both spending and item weight while shopping.
