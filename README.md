# IoT-Based-Smart-Trolley-System

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is an IoT-based smart shopping trolley that simplifies the in-store shopping experience by integrating a manual RFID-based product scanning system and real-time item weight monitoring. The trolley enables users to scan each item by placing its RFID tag on a reader, calculates the total cost, and displays important data like item prices and weight directly on onboard displays.

With separate display unitsâ€”LCD for item prices and total cost, and a 0.95" OLED (SSD1306) for weight trackingâ€”this project offers a step towards more interactive and self-service shopping in smart retail setups.

 Key Features
 Manual RFID Scanning: Users scan items by placing RFID tags on the reader; the system then identifies the item and fetches its price.

 Real-Time Billing: Automatically calculates and displays the total bill and item-wise prices on an LCD screen.

 Weight Display on OLED: Shows the live weight of items in the trolley using HX711 + Load Cell, output on a 0.95-inch OLED (SSD1306) display.

 Dual Display System:

LCD: Item name, price, total cost.

OLED: Total weight in kilograms or grams.

IoT Expandable: Design is modular for future integration with cloud platforms and mobile applications.
